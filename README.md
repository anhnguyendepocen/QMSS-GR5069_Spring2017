# QMSS G5069 -  TOPICS IN APPLIED DATA SCIENCE FOR SOCIAL SCIENTISTS

[Marco Morales](mailto:mam2519@columbia.edu), Columbia University

This repository is a companion to the course **Topics in Applied Data
Science for Social Scientists** taught at the
[Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences](http://qmss.columbia.edu/)
program over the Spring of 2017.

It contains required readings, slides, code examples, and starter files for
data challenges. Also, the [Wiki](https://github.com/marco-morales/QMSS-GR5069/wiki) on this
repository contains additional information and resources related to
each week's material and other relevant topics. Make sure to check it
regularly. 

## Overview

In his now classic [Venn diagram](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram), Drew Conway described **Data Science** as sitting at
the intersection between **good hacking skills**, **math
  and statistics knowledge**, and **substantive expertise**. By
training, social scientists possess a fluid combination of all three,
but also bring an additional layer to the mix. We have acquired
slightly different training, skills and expertise tailored to
understand human behavior, and to explain why things happen
the way they do. Social scientists are, thus, a
particular kind of data scientist.


*This course is not intended to teach students how to code, create
  visualizations, or estimate models. It presumes you have learned
  that in other classes.* This course is intended to take students to the
  next level in becoming a data scientist. Therefore you will:
  
* learn current best practices in data science that will
  facilitate collaboration with data scientists trained in engineering
  or other hard sciences,
* learn soft skills that are key to a successful interaction with
  business stakeholders, and
* get exposed to data science practitioners and explore real-life
  applications from a social science perspective.

All of these are highly valued skills in the data science job market,
but seldom considered as part of an integral training for data
scientists.

## Prerequisites:

It is assumed that students have basic to intermediate knowledge of [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/),
including experience using it for data manipulation, visualizations,
and model estimation. Some mathematics, statistics, econometrics and
algebra will also be assumed.


## Course Resources

There are no required textbooks for this course, but you might find
these to be very useful resources for the course and later in your
careers:

## To actively participate on this course

By the second session, make sure to have the latest versions of
[__R__](https://www.r-project.org/), [__RStudio__](https://www.rstudio.com/), and
[Git](https://git-scm.com/) on your computer.


### Accessing course materials

You have two options to access the materials on this repository:

1. **Dynamic:** Clone the repository by clicking on the on the  "Open
    in Desktop" button.  If you do not have a git
    client installed on your system, you will need to
    [get one here](https://git-scm.com/download/gui) and also to make
    sure that [git is installed](https://git-scm.com/downloads).  This
    is perhaps best, since you can refresh your clone as new content gets
    pushed.
	
3. **Static:** download the entire repository as a zip file  by
    clicking on the on the  "Download ZIP" button. Note that
    you will have to download it again every time it is updated (and
    it will be updated at leas weekly during the semester). 
	
You can also subscribe to the repository.This will send you updates
each time new changes are pushed to the repository.
